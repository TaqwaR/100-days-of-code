# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 28th, 2016
##### It begins

**Today's Progress**: I begin the challenge by forking this repo,  and setting up the log. 

**Thoughts:** I plan to study OAuth 2.0 and try to do some hack integrations with 3rd party service providers like Flickr or Twitter. I've never done much with OAuth2.0 so this should be fun!
